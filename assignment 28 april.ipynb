    "Hierarchical clustering is a type of clustering algorithm that builds a tree-like structure of nested clusters, known as a dendrogram. It differs from other clustering techniques in that it creates a hierarchy of clusters rather than directly assigning data points to fixed clusters. Hierarchical clustering has two main approaches: agglomerative (bottom-up) and divisive (top-down).\n",
    "\n",
    "Agglomerative hierarchical clustering starts with each data point as its own cluster and merges the most similar clusters iteratively until all data points belong to a single cluster. Divisive hierarchical clustering, on the other hand, begins with all data points in a single cluster and recursively splits the clusters until each data point forms its own cluster."

    "Yes, hierarchical clustering can be used for both numerical and categorical data.\n",

    "Hierarchical clustering can be used to identify outliers by analyzing the dendrogram. Outliers are often represented as singleton clusters (clusters with only one data point) that are far away from other clusters. By setting an appropriate height threshold on the dendrogram, outliers can be identified as separate clusters that are not part of the main cluster structure."
